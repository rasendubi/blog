Hi there.

My name is Alexey Shmalko and I'm a young programmer, curious about almost any aspect of programming or computer: from novel programming languages and machine learning down to digital design and computer architecture.

I study at the Faculty of Informatics and Computer Engineering of Kiev Polytechnic Institute. Apart from that, I work for a company that is developing an operating system for embedded devices.

It would be great if you find my blog interesting.

And one more thing. English is not my native language, but I promise to write as well as I can. Nevertheless, I will make mistakes. So, if you find one, please let me know.
