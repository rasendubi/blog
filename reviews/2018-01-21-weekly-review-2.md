## Org-mode

- **[Orgmode for GTD](https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html)**

    Almost nothing special for me (as I already use all of the described features).

    Tickler is a nice idea: put all tasks that should be done on specific date in a separate file, so they don't bother you when you browse through you project now.
- **[Replacing cloud-based To-Do apps with Orgzly and Syncthing](https://medium.com/@JosephKiran/replacing-cloud-based-to-do-apps-with-orgzly-and-syncthing-6a065419d61)**

    Synchronization for org-mode and mobile application.
- **[Projects in Emacs Org](http://sachachua.com/blog/2008/01/projects-in-emacs-org/)**
- **[David O'Toole's org-mode configuration for Getting Things Done](https://gist.github.com/dandrews/4644693)**

    Disable indentation inside org tasks.
    ```
    (setq org-adapt-indentation nil)
    ```
    Indentation does not play well with version control system (diffing after refile). It also plays badly with org-babel (indentation is almost unpredictable).
