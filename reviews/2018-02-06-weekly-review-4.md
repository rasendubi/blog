Nix 1.12 is going to be released as Nix 2.0.

## Firefox Quantum
Mozilla has released a new version of Firefox that is based on a new engine Servo (written in Rust). I am currently evaluating it and I like it so for. It seems to be a little faster than Chrome, though missing some features I need and used to. Now, I use Firefox for day-to-day browsing and use Chrome for web development (Firefox did hang a couple of times during development).

## Productivity and well-being

    There are four simple steps to the Feynman Technique:
    
    1. Choose a Concept
    2. Teach it to a Toddler
    3. Identify Gaps and Go Back to The Source Material
    4. Review and Simplify (optional)

    I'll risk it, though, and tell you again that there really aren't shortcuts to health. Here's what you need to do:
    
    1. Get enough sleep.
    2. Move your body throughout the day.
    3. Eat well — a healthy assortment of foods. Mostly plants, and not too much. (An idea popularized by author Michael Pollan.)
    4. Interact socially. Isolation is not good for the body, soul or mind.
    5. Take some time to reflect on what you are grateful for.

    1. Record the outcome
    2. Take baby steps
    3. Learn from others
    4. Be the outcome
    5. Be willing to be uncomfortable
    6. Be your own cheerleader
