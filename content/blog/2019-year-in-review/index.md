The year 2019 turned out to be extremely fruitful---especially on changes.
If someone told me a year ago that I would be a vegetarian, sleeping good 8 hours, and trying to live a slower life, I would not believe him.

## Unemployment

In September 2018, I left my job to build a startup, so at the start of 2019, I was still unemployed working on that product.
I quit the startup at the end of the Spring, and started on a new job in September 2019.

I was funemployed for a full year, receiving zero income, and burned through most of my cash.
(Would do that again if I could :D)

I believe that having this year off gave me the time to slow down and reflect.

## Life Purpose

The reason I left the startup is that I felt I am not enjoying it anymore.
Besides the fact that we committed every startup mistake possible, and I felt like we have virtually zero chances for success, it felt inauthentic to me.
It's like... not the difference that I would like to make in the world.

Ready to hear my life purpose?
*I want to make programming better.*
(I know it's broad.)

For the last six months, I've been working on the idea of projectional/structural code editors.
I don't have anything worthy to show off yet, but hey, I'm here for the long run.

That said, I still have my day job, but it's more of a background thing now---my main effort goes into code editors.

## Programming

By the way, 2019 is my anniversary year: I've been programming for 10 years now.

## Reading

I've read 37 books, re-read one, abandoned a couple, and three more are in progress.

(Well, I didn't know I've read that much. I think that's [the slight edge][slight-edge] in action.)

I've started ordering paper books from Amazon.
(It's hard to get English books in Ukraine otherwise, and Amazon isn't exactly convenient here.)
It is more pricey, but who cares.

I still read ebooks, but paper ones are better sometimes:
- Better imagery. If a book is high on visuals, it might be hard to read on Kindle. This is especially important for design books.
- You can share paper books. I love sharing books, and you can't do that with ebooks.

The things I would like to do in 2020: try more audiobooks and maybe buy a bookshelf :)

## Meditation and Consciousness

I have started meditating on September--October 2018.
These were light 5--10 minutes guided meditations from [Simple Habit][simple-habit], Headspace, and some more apps.
It didn't stick, though.

I have re-started the meditation habit on December 24, 2018, in a more hardcore way: unguided (that is, in silence) meditations for 20--40 minutes following [The Mind Illuminated][the-mind-illuminated].
I've skipped only 11 days this year, and my current streak is 239 consecutive days.

That said, meditation is only a part of the more massive effort on increasing consciousness, but it's foundational.

The benefits from the whole effort so far:
- *I am better at identifying and handling emotions.* A year ago, I would say that I am not an emotional person. I am. (Everyone is.)
- *Less bullshitting to myself and others.* I've uncovered some ways I've been self-deceiving myself and pretended I am the person I am not. I am also better at detecting masks and hats I wear and stripping that off. I burned my 2019 year plan because it was completely off now.
- *I handle loneliness better, and I can be alone for long periods.* Not that I am hiding and avoiding social contact, I am just less *needy:* I don't feel like I *need* to talk to somebody all the time. It's freeing.

## Sleep

I've changed my relationship to sleep from "sleep is for the weak" to "sleep is essential for high productivity and creativity."

I try to keep my sleep free-running: without an alarm clock.

I also learned that I actually love working in the morning.
That was quite a surprise for me as I was a night owl.
Mornings are just soo much better when you wake up naturally and don't have to rush.

## Exercise

I exercise 2--4 times a week.
Two regular gym days, two Muay Thai ones.

I've been skipping Muay Thai a lot, though, and would like to be more consistent here.

## Diet

I have cleaned up my diet.
I stopped eating junk food, started cooking more.
I started eating more fruits and vegetables.
Eventually, I stopped eating meat.

Though, I'm still working on adjusting my diet and learning more about food.

## Sustainability

I am learning more about ecology and sustainable living, producing less waste, using less plastic, etc.

## 2020

I am working on a prototype of a projectional editor, and I hope I will have something to show in 2020.

I hope I'll have a couple of people to join my effort as I feel a little underpowered.
Building software together is also more fun!

Other than that, I would like to continue my work on consciousness as it is such a high yield area and keeps on giving.

_P.S. I would like to thank my girlfriend, who catalyzed my metamorphosis and also changed quite a bit._
