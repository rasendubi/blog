## Nix

- **[[Nix-dev] NixOS Security Advisory: Docker Local Privilege Escalation](http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2017-April/023329.html)**. My first reported security issue.


## Group dynamics
- **[Shirky: A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy](http://www.shirky.com/writings/herecomeseverybody/group_enemy.html)**

## Security
- **[Opportunistic TLS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS)**
- **[Forward secrecy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy)**
- **[Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm)**
- **[Why I've Retired My PGP Keys and What's Replaced It](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/03/12/)**

## Rust
I am working on integrating [Rust Futures](https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs) into my [Rust kernel](/2015/bkernel-a-rust-operating-system/). That goes really well and is a lot of fun!

- **[rfcs/0000-pi-types.md at pi-types Â· ticki/rfcs](https://github.com/ticki/rfcs/blob/pi-types/text/0000-pi-types.md)**. Dependent types for Rust. The proposal has been split into tree and the tracking issued is [rust-lang/rfcs#1930](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1930). I am really waiting for implementation of the first part of the proposal as it will allow implementing generic fixes-size containers. (All my current containers are hard-coded to a single size.)

## Misc
- **[6 Things Every Mentor Should Do](https://hbr.org/2017/03/6-things-every-mentor-should-do)**
- **[1M downloads of an open source project](http://ivanakimov.com/1m-downloads-of-an-open-source-project/)**

## Dwarf Fortress
I have started playing [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) again. That's a lot of [fun](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Losing)!
